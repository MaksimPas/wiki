Update documentation:
- NFS server installed
- k8s metrics server installed.
- Prometheus and Grafana installed. PVC ok. Prometheus targets ok but need fix.

Next steps: 
- Move k8s manifests to separate repo
- Start using helm as package manager
- Use resource limits and requests for pods. 
- Cluster monitoring via Prometheus ok, but need smth for pod monitoring. Elastic stack?
